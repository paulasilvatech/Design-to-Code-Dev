# Exercise Solutions

This directory contains reference solutions for all workshop exercises. These solutions represent one possible approach - there are often multiple valid ways to solve each exercise.

## 📋 How to Use These Solutions

1. **Try First**: Always attempt the exercise yourself before looking at solutions
2. **Compare Approaches**: Use solutions to compare with your implementation
3. **Learn Patterns**: Study the patterns and best practices demonstrated
4. **Ask Questions**: If a solution differs from yours, understand why
