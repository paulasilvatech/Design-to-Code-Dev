# ðŸš€ 1-Hour Figma to Code Demo Session

This directory contains materials for a 1-hour demonstration of how to convert Figma designs into production-ready code using VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI.

## Session Overview

This demonstration is designed to showcase the practical application of the concepts covered in the main Design-to-Code Playbook. In just one hour, participants will see how to:

1. Extract design tokens from Figma
2. Create a React component based on a Figma design
3. Use GitHub Copilot to accelerate development
4. Implement responsive behavior
5. Add interactivity and state management

## Session Materials

- [**step-by-step-guide.md**](./step-by-step-guide.md) - Comprehensive guide for participants to follow along
- `demo-script.md` - Detailed script for presenters to follow
- `starter-code/` - Initial code to begin the demonstration
- `final-code/` - Completed code for reference
- `slides/` - Presentation slides for the demo session
- `figma-assets/` - Links to Figma files and assets used in the demo

## Prerequisites for Participants

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with React concepts (components, props, state)
- GitHub account (for accessing Copilot)
- VS Code installed with GitHub Copilot extension
- Node.js and npm installed

## Running the Demo

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the starter-code directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Follow along with the [step-by-step guide](./step-by-step-guide.md)

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understanding the Figma to code workflow
- Leveraging AI tools to accelerate development
- Implementing design tokens for consistency
- Creating responsive and accessible components
- Best practices for production-ready code

## Next Steps

After completing this demo, participants should explore the full [Design-to-Code Playbook](../../README.md) for in-depth guidance and the [3-Hour Workshop](../../workshops/03-hour-workshop/README.md) for hands-on practice.
