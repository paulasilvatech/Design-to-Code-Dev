# Framework Implementation

This section provides an overview of implementing Figma designs in different frontend frameworks.

## Overview

Converting Figma designs to code requires understanding how to implement components, styles, and interactions in your chosen framework. This section covers implementation approaches for popular frontend frameworks.

## Framework Options

### React Implementation

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn how to implement Figma designs in React in the [React Implementation](/docs/react-implementation) guide, covering:

- Component architecture
- Styling approaches (Styled Components, Tailwind CSS)
- State management
- Performance optimization

### Angular Implementation

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications. Discover how to implement Figma designs in Angular in the [Angular Implementation](/docs/angular-implementation) guide, covering:

- Component architecture
- Angular Material integration
- Services and state management
- Testing components

### Component Library Implementation

For larger projects, implementing a component library ensures consistency and reusability. Learn more in the [Component Library Implementation](/docs/component_library) guide, covering:

- Component library structure
- Design token implementation
- Documentation with Storybook
- Publishing and versioning

## Best Practices

Regardless of your chosen framework, follow these best practices:

1. **Maintain design fidelity**: Ensure your implementation matches the Figma design
2. **Ensure accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines as described in [Accessibility and Responsiveness](/docs/accessibility_responsiveness)
3. **Write comprehensive tests**: Test your components as outlined in [Testing and Quality Assurance](/docs/testing_qa)
4. **Document your components**: Create clear documentation for your team

## Getting Started with Framework Implementation

To get started implementing Figma designs in your chosen framework:

1. Set up your development environment as described in [Setting Up Environment](/docs/setting-up-environment)
2. Configure GitHub Copilot for your framework
3. Follow the framework-specific implementation guide
4. Implement a component library if needed

By following these framework implementation guidelines, you'll be able to efficiently convert your Figma designs into high-quality, maintainable code.
