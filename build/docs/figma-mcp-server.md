# Figma MCP Server Integration

The Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a direct connection between Figma designs and GitHub Copilot, enabling more accurate and context-aware code generation. This section covers how to set up and use the Figma MCP server in your workflow.

## What are MCP Servers?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide a standardized way for AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. In our workflow, the Figma MCP Server provides design information directly to GitHub Copilot.

## Installing and Configuring Figma MCP Server

```bash
# Install the Figma Developer MCP globally
npm install -g figma-developer-mcp

# Run the server
figma-developer-mcp --figma-api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

For persistent configuration, add to VS Code settings.json:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "figma": {
      "command": "figma-developer-mcp",
      "args": ["--figma-api-key=${env:FIGMA_API_KEY}"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Figma MCP Tools

Once configured, you'll have access to new tools in GitHub Copilot:

- `get_figma_file`: Retrieve entire Figma file information
- `get_figma_node`: Get details about specific components
- `download_figma_images`: Extract images and icons

## Using Figma MCP with GitHub Copilot

### Example: Retrieving Component Details

In GitHub Copilot Chat, you can use:

```
/agent Use the Figma MCP to get details about the Button component 
from https://www.figma.com/file/abc123
```

### Example: Converting a Specific Component

```
/agent Use the Figma MCP to get the Card component from 
https://www.figma.com/file/abc123 and convert it to a React component 
using styled-components
```

### Example: Extracting Design Tokens

```
/agent Use the Figma MCP to extract all color variables from 
https://www.figma.com/file/abc123 and create a theme.js file with 
these colors as CSS variables
```

## Best Practices for Figma MCP Integration

1. **Organize Figma Files**: Structure your Figma files with clear component hierarchies for better MCP extraction

2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your Figma components and styles with clear, descriptive names that translate well to code

3. **Link to Specific Nodes**: When possible, link to specific component nodes rather than entire files

4. **Combine with GitHub Copilot Agent**: Use the agent mode for more complex interactions with Figma designs

5. **Cache Design Information**: For large projects, consider caching Figma design information locally

## Troubleshooting Figma MCP Server

If you encounter issues with the Figma MCP server:

1. Verify your Figma API key has the correct permissions
2. Check that the Figma file is accessible with your account
3. Ensure the MCP server is running before using it with GitHub Copilot
4. Look for error messages in the VS Code output panel under "MCP: figma"

By integrating the Figma MCP server into your workflow, you'll enable GitHub Copilot to generate more accurate code that closely matches your design specifications.
