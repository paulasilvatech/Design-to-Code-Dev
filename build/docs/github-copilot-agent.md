# GitHub Copilot Integration

GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI pair programmer that can significantly accelerate the Figma-to-code conversion process. This section covers how to effectively use GitHub Copilot for design implementation.

## Enabling GitHub Copilot in VS Code

1. Install GitHub Copilot extension
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Enable Copilot agent mode (through Command Palette)
4. Configure custom instructions for your project

## Custom Instructions for Figma-to-Code

Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your project:

```markdown
## Design-to-Code Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all component development
- Follow Atomic Design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Implement responsive design using flexbox and CSS Grid
- Generate accessibility-compliant code (WCAG AA)
- Use styled-components for React / SCSS for Angular

## Structure
- Create components in a consistent folder structure
- Include storybook documentation
- Add appropriate unit tests
- Follow design tokens from Figma
```

## Effective Prompting Techniques

### Simple Component Request:
```
Create a Button component based on the Figma design with:
- Primary, secondary, and outlined variants
- Small, medium, and large sizes
- Support for left and right icons
- Disabled state styling
- Loading state with spinner
```

### Complex Component Request:
```
Generate a DataTable component that:
1. Supports sorting by column
2. Includes pagination
3. Allows row selection
4. Implements responsive behavior for mobile
5. Has a search/filter function
6. Matches the Figma design's visual styling
```

### For Component Tree Generation:
```
Analyze the main dashboard layout from the Figma design and:
1. Create a component hierarchy diagram
2. Generate the necessary component files
3. Implement the layout structure
4. Connect components with proper props drilling
```

## GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

Agent mode provides a more conversational interface for complex tasks:

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "GitHub Copilot: Start Agent Session"
3. Use the `/help` command to see available options

Example agent conversation:
```
You: /help
Agent: Here are some commands you can use:
- /file <filename> - Show the contents of a file
- /new <filename> - Create a new file
- /workspace - List files in the workspace
- /fix - Fix problems in the current file
- /explain - Explain the selected code

You: /workspace
Agent: [Lists files in your project]

You: I need to convert this Figma component to React: [paste Figma component JSON]
Agent: [Provides React component implementation]
```

## Copilot Chat for Design Questions

Use Copilot Chat to ask design-related questions:

1. Open Copilot Chat panel in VS Code
2. Ask questions about design patterns, implementation approaches, or accessibility

Example questions:
- "What's the best way to implement this responsive layout from Figma?"
- "How should I structure the component props based on these Figma variants?"
- "Can you suggest a state management approach for this complex form?"

By mastering these GitHub Copilot techniques, you'll dramatically accelerate your Figma-to-code workflow and improve the quality of your implementations.
