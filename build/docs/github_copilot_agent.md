# GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Agent

GitHub Copilot has evolved significantly from its initial release as a code completion tool to become a powerful AI assistant capable of handling complex tasks in the design-to-code workflow. This section explores how to leverage GitHub Copilot and the newer GitHub Copilot Agent specifically for Figma-to-code conversion.

## Understanding GitHub Copilot for Design-to-Code

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that can assist with various coding tasks, including converting Figma designs to code. The latest version includes:

1. **Inline Code Suggestions**: Automatically suggests code as you type
2. **Chat Interface**: Allows natural language conversations about code
3. **Agent Mode**: Enables autonomous task execution
4. **MCP Integration**: Connects with external tools like Figma

For Figma-to-code conversion, GitHub Copilot can dramatically reduce development time by:

- Generating component structures based on Figma designs
- Creating CSS/SCSS styles that match design specifications
- Implementing responsive behaviors
- Suggesting accessibility improvements

## GitHub Copilot Agent: The Next Evolution

The GitHub Copilot Agent represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted development. Unlike the standard Copilot, which primarily offers suggestions, the Agent can:

1. **Execute Complex Tasks**: Implement entire features autonomously
2. **Integrate with External Tools**: Connect directly with Figma via MCP
3. **Run in Background**: Complete tasks asynchronously with GitHub Actions
4. **Understand Project Context**: Consider your codebase, style, and patterns

### Enabling and Configuring GitHub Copilot Agent

To use GitHub Copilot Agent for Figma-to-code conversion:

1. **Enable Agent Mode**:
   ```
   Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) > GitHub Copilot: Enable Agent Mode
   ```

2. **Access the Agent**:
   - Via Copilot Chat panel: `/agent`
   - Via command palette: "GitHub Copilot: Start Agent Task"

3. **Configure Agent Behavior**:
   Create a `.github/copilot-agent-config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "figmaIntegration": {
       "enabled": true,
       "preferredExtractionMethod": "mcp",
       "componentNamingStrategy": "figmaToCode"
     },
     "codeGeneration": {
       "framework": "react", // or "angular"
       "styling": "styled-components", // or "scss", "tailwind"
       "typescript": true,
       "accessibility": "wcagAA"
     },
     "agentBehavior": {
       "autonomyLevel": "high",
       "feedbackFrequency": "milestone",
       "errorHandling": "suggestFixes"
     }
   }
   ```

## Effective Prompting Techniques for Figma-to-Code

The quality of code generated by GitHub Copilot Agent depends significantly on how you structure your prompts. Here are effective prompting strategies specifically for Figma-to-code conversion:

### Basic Component Request

5. Use our existing navigation and card components
6. Ensure the layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
```

### Design System Implementation

```
/agent Extract the design system from this Figma file and implement it as a code library:
https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System

Please:
1. Create a theme configuration with all colors, typography, and spacing
2. Generate base components for all atoms in the design system
3. Implement the component variants as shown in Figma
4. Create a documentation page showcasing all components
5. Set up Storybook stories for each component
```

## Using GitHub Copilot Agent with Figma MCP Server

When GitHub Copilot Agent is connected to a Figma MCP Server, it gains powerful capabilities for design-to-code conversion:

### Available Tools Through MCP

Once configured, GitHub Copilot Agent can use these Figma-specific tools:

1. **get_figma_file**: Retrieve comprehensive information about a Figma file
   ```
   /agent Use get_figma_file to analyze the structure of https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System
   ```

2. **get_figma_node**: Get detailed information about a specific component or frame
   ```
   /agent Use get_figma_node to extract the Button component from https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System?node-id=123-456
   ```

3. **download_figma_images**: Extract images and icons from a Figma file
   ```
   /agent Use download_figma_images to get all icons from https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System?node-id=789-012
   ```

### Example Workflow: Complete Component Library Generation

Here's an example of a complete workflow using GitHub Copilot Agent with Figma MCP Server:

```
/agent I need to convert our entire design system from Figma to a React component library.

Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System

Please:
1. Analyze the design system structure
2. Extract all design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Generate a theme configuration file
4. Create base components for all atoms (buttons, inputs, etc.)
5. Implement component variants as shown in Figma
6. Set up Storybook for documentation
7. Ensure all components are accessible and responsive
8. Add unit tests for each component
```

The agent will:
1. Use `get_figma_file` to analyze the overall structure
2. Extract design tokens and create a theme configuration
3. Use `get_figma_node` for each component to extract detailed properties
4. Generate component code based on the extracted information
5. Use `download_figma_images` for any icons or images
6. Create Storybook stories and unit tests
7. Organize everything into a coherent component library

## GitHub Copilot Agent for Continuous Design-Code Synchronization

One of the most powerful applications of GitHub Copilot Agent is maintaining synchronization between Figma designs and code as designs evolve:

### Setting Up Design-Code Sync

1. **Create a GitHub Action Workflow**:
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/figma-sync.yml
   name: Figma Design Sync
   
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
     workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
   
   jobs:
     sync-design-system:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         
         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '18'
             
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm ci
           
         - name: Run Figma sync script
           run: node scripts/figma-sync.js
           env:
             FIGMA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_API_KEY }}
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             FIGMA_FILE_ID: 'abc123'
   ```

2. **Create a Sync Script**:
   ```javascript
   // scripts/figma-sync.js
   const { execSync } = require('child_process');
   
   // This script uses GitHub Copilot Agent CLI to sync Figma designs
   async function syncDesigns() {
     // Use GitHub Copilot Agent to check for design changes
     execSync(`gh copilot agent run "Check for changes in Figma design https://www.figma.com/file/${process.env.FIGMA_FILE_ID} and update affected components"`);
   }
   
   syncDesigns().catch(console.error);
   ```

### Handling Design Changes

When designs change in Figma, GitHub Copilot Agent can:

1. **Identify Changed Components**: Compare current code with updated designs
2. **Update Component Code**: Modify only the affected components
3. **Preserve Custom Logic**: Keep business logic while updating visual aspects
4. **Create Pull Requests**: Submit changes for review rather than direct commits
5. **Document Changes**: Add comments explaining what was updated and why

## Best Practices for GitHub Copilot Agent with Figma

To get the most out of GitHub Copilot Agent for Figma-to-code conversion:

1. **Start with Clear Component Boundaries**:
   - Have well-defined components in Figma
   - Use consistent naming conventions

2. **Provide Context in Prompts**:
   - Mention your tech stack and preferences
   - Reference existing patterns in your codebase

3. **Review and Refine**:
   - Treat generated code as a starting point
   - Review for edge cases and optimizations

4. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Start with simple components before complex ones
   - Build up your design system incrementally

5. **Maintain Documentation**:
   - Document the relationship between Figma components and code
   - Keep a mapping of Figma node IDs to component files

6. **Version Control**:
   - Commit generated code in logical chunks
   - Use meaningful commit messages referencing Figma versions

By leveraging GitHub Copilot Agent with these strategies, you can establish a highly efficient workflow for converting Figma designs to production-quality code, significantly reducing development time while maintaining high fidelity to the original designs.
