# AI Tools Integration

This section provides an overview of the various AI tools that can be integrated into your Figma-to-code workflow.

## Overview

AI tools can significantly accelerate the process of converting Figma designs to code by automating repetitive tasks, generating boilerplate code, and providing intelligent suggestions. This section covers the key AI tools that can be integrated into your workflow.

## Key AI Tools

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that can help you write code faster and with fewer errors. Learn how to effectively use it for design-to-code conversion in the [GitHub Copilot Integration](/docs/github-copilot-agent) guide.

### Figma MCP Server

The Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a direct connection between Figma designs and GitHub Copilot. Discover how to set it up and use it in the [Figma MCP Server Integration](/docs/figma-mcp-server) guide.

### Visual Copilot and Cursor

For specialized design-to-code workflows, tools like Visual Copilot and Cursor offer unique features. Learn more in the [Visual Copilot and Cursor](/docs/visual-copilot-cursor) guide.

### Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry provides powerful AI capabilities for design analysis and code generation. Explore its features in the [Azure AI Foundry Integration](/docs/azure-ai-foundry) guide.

## Choosing the Right Tools

The best AI tools for your workflow depend on your specific needs:

- **For general coding assistance**: GitHub Copilot
- **For direct Figma integration**: Figma MCP Server
- **For specialized design-to-code workflows**: Visual Copilot or Cursor
- **For enterprise-level AI capabilities**: Azure AI Foundry

## Getting Started with AI Tools

To get started with AI tools for Figma-to-code conversion:

1. Set up your development environment as described in [Setting Up Environment](/docs/setting-up-environment)
2. Install and configure GitHub Copilot
3. Set up the Figma MCP Server for enhanced design context
4. Explore specialized tools like Visual Copilot or Azure AI Foundry as needed

By integrating these AI tools into your workflow, you'll be able to convert Figma designs to code more efficiently and with higher quality results.
