# Getting Started

This section provides an overview of the essential steps to begin converting Figma designs to code using AI tools.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the Figma-to-code conversion process, ensure you have:

1. **Figma Account**: Free or paid account with access to your design files
2. **GitHub Account**: With GitHub Copilot access enabled
3. **Development Environment**: VS Code with necessary extensions installed
4. **Framework Knowledge**: Basic understanding of React or Angular

## Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to quickly get started with Figma-to-code conversion:

1. **Prepare your Figma designs** following the guidelines in [Preparing Figma Designs](/docs/preparing-figma-designs)
2. **Set up your development environment** as described in [Setting Up Environment](/docs/setting-up-environment)
3. **Configure GitHub Copilot** for design conversion as outlined in [GitHub Copilot Integration](/docs/github-copilot-agent)
4. **Choose your framework** implementation approach: [React](/docs/react-implementation) or [Angular](/docs/angular-implementation)
5. **Start converting components** using the techniques described in the framework-specific guides

## Workshop Options

Depending on your available time, you can follow one of our workshop formats:

- [1-Hour Workshop](/docs/workshop-1-hour): Quick introduction to core concepts
- [3-Hour Workshop](/docs/workshop-3-hour): Comprehensive implementation with all key scenarios

## Next Steps

After completing the getting started guide, explore these additional topics:

- [Figma MCP Server Integration](/docs/figma-mcp-server) for enhanced design context
- [Component Library Implementation](/docs/component_library) for scalable design systems
- [Accessibility and Responsiveness](/docs/accessibility_responsiveness) for inclusive design
- [Testing and Quality Assurance](/docs/testing_qa) for robust implementations

By following this getting started guide, you'll be well-equipped to begin converting your Figma designs into high-quality code using AI-assisted tools.
