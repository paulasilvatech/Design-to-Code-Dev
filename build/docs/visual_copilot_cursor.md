### Using Cursor for Figma-to-Code Conversion

Cursor offers several powerful workflows for implementing Figma designs:

#### Direct Design Reference

```
// In Cursor's AI chat
/create a React component for the navigation bar in this Figma design: 
https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Website?node-id=10-25

Use styled-components and make it responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
```

#### Component Implementation with Context

```
// In Cursor's AI chat
/implement the DataTable component from our Figma design system:
https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System?node-id=45-67

It should:
1. Match our existing component patterns
2. Support sorting, filtering, and pagination
3. Use our theme tokens for styling
4. Be fully accessible
```

#### Design System Implementation

```
// In Cursor's AI chat
/help me implement our entire design system from Figma:
https://www.figma.com/file/abc123/Design-System

Let's start by:
1. Extracting all design tokens
2. Creating the theme configuration
3. Implementing base components
4. Then building more complex components
```

### Configuration Rules for Cursor

Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root to guide Cursor's code generation:

```json
{
  "codeStyle": {
    "indentation": "spaces",
    "indentSize": 2,
    "lineLength": 80,
    "quoteStyle": "single"
  },
  "componentStyle": {
    "framework": "react",
    "styling": "styled-components",
    "typescript": true,
    "componentPattern": "functional",
    "propsInterface": true,
    "defaultExport": true
  },
  "naming": {
    "components": "PascalCase",
    "props": "camelCase",
    "files": "PascalCase",
    "styles": "camelCase"
  }
}
```
