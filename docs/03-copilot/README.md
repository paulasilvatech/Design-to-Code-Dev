 *    - selectable: boolean to enable/disable selection
 *    - pagination: boolean to enable/disable pagination
 *    - onRowClick: function called when row is clicked
 *    - onSelectionChange: function called when selection changes
 */
```

### Layout Prompts

```javascript
/**
 * Create a responsive layout component based on the Figma design with:
 * 
 * 1. Structure:
 *    - Header with logo, navigation, and user menu
 *    - Sidebar (collapsible on mobile)
 *    - Main content area
 *    - Footer with 3 columns
 * 
 * 2. Responsive behavior:
 *    - Desktop (1024px+): Full layout with expanded sidebar
 *    - Tablet (768px-1023px): Collapsed sidebar, toggleable with button
 *    - Mobile (<768px): Hidden sidebar, accessible through hamburger menu
 * 
 * 3. Props:
 *    - children: content for the main area
 *    - navigationItems: array of navigation links
 *    - userMenuItems: array of user menu options
 *    - footerContent: object with footer column content
 */
```

### Component with Animation Prompts

```javascript
/**
 * Create a Modal component with entrance/exit animations:
 * 
 * 1. Behavior:
 *    - Appears with fade-in animation (300ms)
 *    - Background overlay darkens (opacity 0 to 0.5)
 *    - Modal slides in from top (transform: translateY(-20px) to translateY(0))
 *    - Exit animations reverse the entrance
 * 
 * 2. Structure:
 *    - Overlay background (position: fixed, covers entire viewport)
 *    - Modal container with max-width: 500px
 *    - Header with title and close button
 *    - Body content area
 *    - Footer with action buttons
 * 
 * 3. Props:
 *    - isOpen: boolean to control visibility
 *    - onClose: function to call when closing
 *    - title: string for the modal header
 *    - children: content for the modal body
 *    - footerActions: array of button configurations
 * 
 * 4. Animation:
 *    - Use framer-motion for animations
 */
```

## Using Copilot Chat

Copilot Chat provides a conversational interface for refining and enhancing your code. It's particularly useful for complex design-to-code conversions.

### Basic Chat Usage

1. **Open Copilot Chat**:
   - Press Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+I (macOS)
   - Or click the Copilot Chat icon in the sidebar

2. **Ask questions about design implementation**:
   - "How would I implement this card component in React?"
   - "What's the best way to handle responsive images in this layout?"
   - "Can you help me convert this Figma color system to CSS variables?"

### Context-Aware Questions

You can select code and ask specific questions about it:

1. **Select component code**
2. **Open Copilot Chat**
3. **Ask focused questions**:
   - "How can I improve the accessibility of this component?"
   - "Can you refactor this to use styled-components instead of inline styles?"
   - "How would you optimize this for performance?"

### Multi-Turn Conversations

Build on previous answers with follow-up questions:

1. **Start with a general question** about implementing a design
2. **Ask for refinements** based on the initial response
3. **Request specific improvements** like adding animations or responsive behavior
4. **Ask for explanations** of the generated code

### Code Refinement Examples

1. **Styling Refinement**:
   ```
   I have this button component from Figma, but the hover states don't match 
   the design. The design shows a 10% darker background on hover, but my 
   implementation uses a different color. Can you help fix this?
   ```

2. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   ```
   This form component looks good, but can you add proper ARIA attributes
   and keyboard navigation support to make it more accessible?
   ```

3. **Responsive Behavior**:
   ```
   The layout works well on desktop, but on mobile the sidebar overlaps
   with the content. How can I modify this to create a proper responsive layout?
   ```

## Converting Figma Components to Code

Here's a step-by-step process for converting Figma components to code using GitHub Copilot.

### Step 1: Analyze the Design

1. **Examine the component** in Figma
2. **Note design tokens** like colors, typography, spacing
3. **Identify variants and states**
4. **Understand responsive behavior**

### Step 2: Create Component Structure

Use descriptive comments to prompt Copilot:

```javascript
/**
 * Card Component
 * 
 * From Figma design:
 * - Rounded corners: 8px
 * - Shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
 * - Padding: 24px
 * - Background: white
 * - Has header, body, and footer sections
 */
```

Let Copilot generate the initial structure:

```jsx
const Card = ({ 
  title, 
  children, 
  footer, 
  variant = 'default' 
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="card card--{variant}">
      {title && <div className="card__header">{title}</div>}
      <div className="card__body">{children}</div>
      {footer && <div className="card__footer">{footer}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Step 3: Style the Component

Describe styles in comments:

```javascript
/**
 * Card Styles
 * 
 * Default variant:
 * - Background: white
 * - Border: 1px solid #E5E7EB
 * 
 * Elevated variant:
 * - Background: white
 * - Box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
 * 
 * Interactive variant:
 * - Same as default, but with hover state:
 *   - Transform: translateY(-2px)
 *   - Box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
 */
```

### Step 4: Implement Variants and States

Create a complete implementation by describing all variants and states:

```javascript
/**
 * Implement all card variants:
 * - default: as described above
 * - compact: smaller padding (16px), tighter spacing
 * - bordered: 2px solid border instead of shadow
 * - colorful: with background color from theme
 * 
 * States:
 * - default: as described
 * - hover: slight scale (1.02) and shadow increase
 * - disabled: 60% opacity, no hover effects
 */
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Style Mismatch

**Problem**: Generated styles don't match exactly with Figma designs.

**Solution**:
1. Provide exact color values, sizes, and spacing in your prompts
2. Include specific CSS properties like `letter-spacing`, `font-weight`
3. Specify units (px, rem, em) for measurements

Example prompt:
```
Create a heading component with exact Figma styling:
- Font: Inter, font-weight: 700
- Size: 24px (desktop), 20px (mobile)
- Line height: 32px (1.33)
- Letter spacing: -0.01em
- Color: #111827
- Margin: 0 0 16px 0
```

### Challenge: Complex Layouts

**Problem**: Multi-column or grid-based layouts are challenging to describe.

**Solution**:
1. Break down layouts into smaller sections
2. Describe each section precisely
3. Specify breakpoints and behavior at each one

Example prompt:
```
Create a product listing grid with:
- 3 columns on desktop (1024px+)
- 2 columns on tablet (768px-1023px)
- 1 column on mobile (<768px)
- 24px gap between items
- Items should maintain aspect ratio
- Each item has image (top), title, price, and action button
```

### Challenge: Interactive Behavior

**Problem**: Complex interactions are difficult to describe and implement.

**Solution**:
1. Break down interactions into distinct states
2. Describe transitions between states
3. Specify timing and easing functions

Example prompt:
```
Create a dropdown menu with the following interactions:
- Closed state: Only shows trigger button
- Opening animation: Menu fades in (150ms) and scales from 0.95 to 1 (200ms, ease-out)
- Open state: Menu displayed below trigger
- Hover state for menu items: Background changes to #F3F4F6
- Closing animation: Menu fades out (100ms) and scales down slightly
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Generating an Entire Component System

You can guide Copilot to generate a consistent set of components:

```
/**
 * Design System Components based on Figma
 * 
 * Create the following components with consistent styling and APIs:
 * 
 * 1. Button (primary, secondary, outlined variants)
 * 2. Input (text, number, password variants)
 * 3. Checkbox and Radio
 * 4. Select dropdown
 * 5. Card (default, elevated variants)
 * 6. Alert (info, success, warning, error variants)
 * 
 * All components should:
 * - Support dark/light themes
 * - Be fully accessible
 * - Use styled-components
 * - Include TypeScript interfaces
 * - Accept common HTML attributes as props
 */
```

### Creating Theme Implementation

To implement a complete theme system from Figma:

```
/**
 * Create a theme system based on Figma design tokens:
 * 
 * 1. Colors:
 *    - Primary: #3B82F6 (with 50, 100, ..., 900 shades)
 *    - Neutral: #1F2937 (with 50, 100, ..., 900 shades)
 *    - Success: #10B981
 *    - Warning: #F59E0B
 *    - Error: #EF4444
 * 
 * 2. Typography:
 *    - Font families: "Inter" (body), "Poppins" (headings)
 *    - Font sizes: 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64
 *    - Line heights: 1.2, 1.5, 1.8
 *    - Font weights: 400, 500, 600, 700
 * 
 * 3. Spacing:
 *    - Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96
 * 
 * 4. Breakpoints:
 *    - sm: 640px
 *    - md: 768px
 *    - lg: 1024px
 *    - xl: 1280px
 * 
 * 5. Create both light and dark themes
