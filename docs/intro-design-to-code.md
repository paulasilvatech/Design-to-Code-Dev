## üìù Key Concepts and Principles

### 1. Design Tokens

Design tokens are the atomic values of your design system - colors, typography, spacing, etc.

```javascript
// Example design tokens
const tokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#0066CC',
    secondary: '#6B46C1',
    success: '#10B981',
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: '0.5rem',
    sm: '1rem',
    md: '1.5rem',
    lg: '2rem',
  },
  typography: {
    heading: {
      fontFamily: 'Inter',
      fontWeight: 700,
      lineHeight: 1.2,
    },
  },
};
```

### 2. Component-Driven Development

Building UIs from a collection of reusable, isolated components.

**Benefits**:
- **Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere
- **Consistency**: Uniform UI across applications
- **Testability**: Isolated component testing
- **Maintainability**: Updates propagate automatically
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend and modify

### 3. Atomic Design Methodology

Organizing components hierarchically:
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs)
- **Molecules**: Simple component groups (form fields)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (headers, cards)
- **Templates**: Page-level layout structures
- **Pages**: Specific instances with real content

### 4. Responsive Design Principles

Creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes:
- **Fluid Grids**: Flexible column systems
- **Flexible Images**: Scalable media
- **Media Queries**: Breakpoint-based styling
- **Container Queries**: Component-based responsiveness
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first

### 5. Accessibility-First Development

Building inclusive interfaces:
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper element usage
- **ARIA Attributes**: Enhanced screen reader support
