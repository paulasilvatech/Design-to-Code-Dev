## Design-to-Code Best Practices

### Component Structure and Organization

1. **Atomic Design Methodology**
   - Organize components as atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages
   - Build complex interfaces from simple, reusable building blocks
   - Create a consistent component hierarchy

2. **Component APIs**
   - Design intuitive, consistent component interfaces
   - Avoid too many props; group related props into objects
   - Use sensible defaults for optional props
   - Document props thoroughly with TypeScript types/interfaces

3. **Establish Clear Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive, consistent naming for components and props
   - Follow platform-specific conventions (e.g., PascalCase for React components)
   - Establish a shared vocabulary between designers and developers

### Design System Implementation

1. **Design Tokens**
   - Extract design values (colors, spacing, typography) into tokens
   - Reference tokens instead of hardcoding values
   - Centralize token definitions for consistent updates

2. **Maintain a Single Source of Truth**
   - Link design tokens directly to Figma variables when possible
   - Document token usage and purpose
   - Automate token synchronization between design and code

3. **Version Your Design System**
   - Treat your design system as a product
   - Follow semantic versioning principles
   - Document changes between versions

### Figma Best Practices

1. **Utilize Auto Layout**
   - Properly set up constraints and Figma auto layout
   - Organize frames to reflect component structure
   - Use variants for component states and variations

2. **Component Instance Management**
   - Use component instances rather than duplicating elements
   - Apply consistent naming for components and variants
   - Organize components into libraries for reuse

3. **Documentation Within Figma**
   - Add detailed component descriptions
   - Document component properties and usage
   - Include interactive states and responsive behavior

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Size Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Load components only when needed
   - Split bundles by route or feature
   - Use dynamic imports for less frequently used components

2. **Tree Shaking**
   - Use ES modules for better tree shaking
   - Import only what you need from libraries
   - Choose libraries that support tree shaking

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Use appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Implement responsive images with srcset
   - Apply proper compression and progressive loading
   - Consider lazy loading for below-the-fold images

### Rendering Performance

1. **Component Rendering Optimization**
   - Implement memoization (React.memo, useMemo)
   - Optimize rendering with virtualization for long lists
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by optimizing state management

2. **CSS Performance**
   - Use CSS-in-JS with static extraction
   - Minimize CSS complexity and specificity
   - Prefer modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox) over complex calculations
   - Avoid expensive CSS properties (box-shadow, filter, etc.) on animated elements

3. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Optimize event handlers (debounce, throttle)
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading

### Loading Performance

1. **Critical Rendering Path**
   - Inline critical CSS
   - Defer non-critical CSS
   - Prioritize loading of critical content

2. **Caching Strategies**
   - Implement appropriate caching headers
   - Use service workers for offline access
   - Consider client-side caching of API responses

3. **Resource Hints**
   - Use preload for critical resources
   - Implement prefetch for future navigation
   - Apply preconnect for third-party domains

## Code Quality and Maintainability

### Code Organization

1. **Project Structure**
   - Organize by feature or type, depending on project size
   - Maintain consistent folder structures
   - Use index files for clean imports

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate concerns (UI, logic, API calls)
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Avoid deeply nested component hierarchies

3. **State Management**
   - Choose appropriate state management solutions for your needs
   - Separate UI state from business logic
   - Implement effective data fetching and caching strategies

### Code Consistency

1. **Linting and Formatting**
   - Use ESLint and Prettier
   - Enforce consistent coding styles
   - Automate with pre-commit hooks

2. **Testing Standards**
   - Implement comprehensive testing strategies
   - Balance unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   - Set coverage thresholds for critical code

3. **Documentation**
   - Document components, functions, and APIs
   - Create usage examples and edge cases
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Accessibility Best Practices

### Design for Accessibility

1. **Color and Contrast**
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum, AAA preferred)
   - Don't rely on color alone to convey information
   - Test designs in grayscale to verify differentiation

2. **Typography and Readability**
   - Use readable font sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
   - Maintain suitable line height (1.5 for body text)
   - Ensure sufficient spacing between paragraphs and sections

3. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Create clear visual hierarchies with headings
   - Use consistent patterns for interaction elements
   - Provide visual feedback for interactive states

### Implementation for Accessibility

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose
   - Apply proper heading levels (h1-h6) in logical order
   - Use landmarks (main, nav, aside) to structure content

2. **ARIA Attributes**
   - Add ARIA attributes only when necessary
   - Ensure proper roles for custom components
   - Test with screen readers to verify functionality

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Implement logical tab order
   - Provide visible focus indicators
   - Support keyboard shortcuts for complex interactions

### Testing for Accessibility

1. **Automated Testing**

   - Test on actual touch devices

### Browser Compatibility

1. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Ensure core functionality works in all supported browsers
