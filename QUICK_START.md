## 🛠️ Essential Tools Setup

### GitHub Copilot
```bash
# Install VS Code extension
code --install-extension GitHub.copilot
```

### Figma Dev Mode
1. Open any Figma file
2. Click "Dev Mode" in top-right
3. Explore component inspection features

### React Development Environment
```bash
# Create new React app
npx create-react-app my-design-system
cd my-design-system
npm start
```

## 🎨 Sample Design Files

To practice with real designs, use these Figma community files:

- **Beginner**: [Material Design Components](https://www.figma.com/community/file/778763161265841481)
- **Intermediate**: [Ant Design System](https://www.figma.com/community/file/831698976089873405)
- **Advanced**: [Apple Design Resources](https://www.figma.com/community/file/858143367356468985)

## 🚨 Common First-Time Issues

### GitHub Copilot Not Working
```bash
# Check Copilot status
code --list-extensions | grep copilot

# Sign in to GitHub
gh auth login
```

### Figma Access Issues
- Ensure you're logged into Figma
- Check file permissions (view or edit access needed)
- Try opening files in incognito mode

### Node.js Version Issues
```bash
# Check Node version
node --version

# Should be 18.0.0 or higher
# Use nvm to manage Node versions if needed
```

## 📚 Key Concepts to Understand

### Design Tokens
Values that represent design decisions (colors, spacing, typography):
```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #0066cc;
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --font-size-lg: 1.25rem;
}
```

### Component-Based Architecture
Building UIs from reusable, isolated components:
```jsx
// Atomic component
const Button = ({ variant, children }) => (
  <button className={`btn btn--${variant}`}>
    {children}
  </button>
);
```

### Figma Auto Layout → CSS Flexbox
Figma's Auto Layout translates directly to CSS Flexbox properties:
- **Direction** → `flex-direction`
- **Spacing** → `gap`
- **Alignment** → `align-items`, `justify-content`

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After completing the quick start, you should be able to:

- [ ] Extract design properties from Figma
- [ ] Generate basic React components with Copilot
- [ ] Apply design tokens in code
- [ ] Create responsive layouts
- [ ] Understand the design-to-code workflow
