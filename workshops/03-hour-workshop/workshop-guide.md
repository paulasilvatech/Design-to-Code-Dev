## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the workshop directory:
   ```bash
   cd workshops/03-hour-workshop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd starter-code
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the project in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

5. Open the Figma file provided by your instructor

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up the Design Token System

**Objective**: Extract design tokens from Figma and create a maintainable token system.

**Steps**:
1. Open the Figma file and examine the design system page
2. Identify colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens
3. Create a `tokens` directory in your project
4. Create separate files for different token categories:
   - `colors.js`
   - `typography.js`
   - `spacing.js`
   - `breakpoints.js`
5. Export all tokens through an index.js file

**Example**:
```javascript
// tokens/colors.js
export const colors = {
  primary: {
    50: '#E3F2FD',
    100: '#BBDEFB',
    500: '#2196F3',
    700: '#1976D2',
    900: '#0D47A1',
  },
  // other color tokens
};

// tokens/index.js
export * from './colors';
export * from './typography';
export * from './spacing';
export * from './breakpoints';
```

### Exercise 2: Creating the Button Component

**Objective**: Build a flexible Button component based on Figma designs.

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the Button component in Figma
2. Identify variants, states, and properties
3. Create a Button component with appropriate props
4. Implement styling using design tokens
5. Add hover, focus, and active states
6. Test with different variants and states

**Hints**:
- Use GitHub Copilot to help with component structure
- Comment on what you want to achieve before letting Copilot suggest code
- Consider accessibility from the beginning

### Exercise 3: Building the Card Component

**Objective**: Create a responsive Card component with different variants.

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the Card component in Figma
2. Create the component structure with proper props
3. Implement styling for different variants
4. Add responsive behavior
5. Use the Button component inside the Card

**Hints**:
- Consider content projection patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment

### Exercise 4: Implementing Form Elements

**Objective**: Build form input components that match the design system.

**Steps**:
1. Create an Input component
2. Add validation states (success, error)
3. Implement a label and helper text
4. Ensure proper accessibility attributes
5. Test with different input types

### Exercise 5: Implementing Component Styles

**Objective**: Apply consistent styling across components.

**Steps**:
1. Choose a styling approach (CSS, CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules)
2. Implement component styles using design tokens
3. Ensure consistent visual appearance
4. Check alignment with Figma designs

### Exercise 6: Adding Responsive Behavior
