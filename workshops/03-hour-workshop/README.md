# ðŸ§ª 3-Hour Figma to Code Workshop

This directory contains materials for a comprehensive 3-hour hands-on workshop that guides participants through the complete process of converting Figma designs into production-ready code.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop provides a deeper, hands-on experience building on the concepts from the Design-to-Code Playbook. Participants will work through a complete project, converting a set of Figma designs into functional components with proper architecture, styling, and interactivity.

## Workshop Timeline

- **00:00-00:15** - Introduction and environment setup
- **00:15-00:45** - Figma design analysis and planning
- **00:45-01:30** - Building the component architecture
- **01:30-02:15** - Implementing styling and responsive behavior
- **02:15-02:45** - Adding interactivity and state management
- **02:45-03:00** - Review, next steps, and Q&A

## Workshop Materials

- [**step-by-step-guide.md**](./step-by-step-guide.md) - Comprehensive guide for participants to follow along
- `workshop-guide.md` - General guide for participants
- `facilitator-guide.md` - Guide for workshop facilitators
- `starter-code/` - Initial code to begin the workshop
- `complete-code/` - Finished code for reference
- `slides/` - Presentation slides for the workshop
- `assets/` - Design files and other resources

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of React
- Familiarity with TypeScript is helpful but not required
- GitHub account (for accessing Copilot)
- VS Code with necessary extensions installed
- Node.js (v14+) and npm

## Setting Up

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the starter-code directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Follow along with the [step-by-step guide](./step-by-step-guide.md)

## Workshop Learning Objectives

- Analyze Figma designs and extract design tokens
- Create a scalable component architecture
- Build reusable React components with TypeScript
- Implement responsive and accessible components
- Create theme variations (light/dark)
- Use GitHub Copilot to accelerate development
- Test and validate component implementations

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will have:
- A complete component library with 5+ components
- Design token system for consistent styling
- Responsive behavior across devices
- Theme switching capability
- Accessible component implementations

## Next Steps

After completing this workshop, explore the complete [Design-to-Code Playbook](../../README.md) for more advanced topics and techniques.
