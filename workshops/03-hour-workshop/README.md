# ðŸ§ª 3-Hour Figma to Code Workshop

This directory contains materials for a comprehensive 3-hour hands-on workshop that guides participants through the complete process of converting Figma designs into production-ready code.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop provides a deeper, hands-on experience building on the concepts from the Design-to-Code Playbook. Participants will work through a complete project, converting a set of Figma designs into functional components with proper architecture, styling, and interactivity.

## Workshop Timeline

- **00:00-00:15** - Introduction and environment setup
- **00:15-00:45** - Figma design analysis and planning
- **00:45-01:30** - Building the component architecture
- **01:30-02:15** - Implementing styling and responsive behavior
- **02:15-02:45** - Adding interactivity and state management
- **02:45-03:00** - Testing, review, and next steps

## Workshop Materials

- `workshop-guide.md` - Detailed instruction guide for participants
- `facilitator-guide.md` - Guide for workshop facilitators
- `starter-code/` - Initial code to begin the workshop
- `solution/` - Completed code for reference
- `exercises/` - Step-by-step exercises
- `assets/` - Images, resources, and Figma files

## Prerequisites for Participants

- Intermediate understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Basic experience with React (components, props, hooks)
- GitHub account with Copilot access
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed
- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic understanding of Git

## Workshop Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the workshop directory:
   ```
   cd workshops/03-hour-workshop
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd starter-code
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open the project in VS Code and follow the workshop guide

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Analyze Figma designs to extract design tokens and component structure
- Create component architecture that follows best practices
- Implement responsive and accessible components
- Use GitHub Copilot effectively to accelerate development
- Add proper interactivity and state management
- Test and validate implementations against designs
- Apply optimization techniques for production-ready code

## Project Outcomes

Participants will build a complete component library based on a Figma design, including:

1. A design token system derived from Figma variables
2. A set of atomic components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
3. A theme provider with light and dark mode support
4. Responsive layouts that work across devices
5. Interactive components with proper state management
6. Accessible components that follow WCAG guidelines
