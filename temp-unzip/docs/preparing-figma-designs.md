# Preparing Figma Designs for Optimal Conversion

Properly organizing and structuring your Figma designs is crucial for efficient conversion to code. This section covers best practices for preparing your Figma files to optimize the AI-assisted code generation process.

## Organizing Figma Files

Structure your Figma files to optimize for AI-powered code generation:

```
Project/
├── 📄 Design System
│   ├── 🎨 Colors & Typography
│   ├── 🧩 Components
│   └── 📐 Spacing & Grid System
├── 📄 Pages
│   ├── 🖼️ Homepage
│   ├── 🖼️ User Dashboard
│   └── 🖼️ Settings
└── 📄 Development-Ready Screens (✅ Ready for Dev)
```

## Key Figma Features to Leverage

### Auto Layout

Auto Layout in Figma directly translates to flexbox or grid in CSS, making it essential for responsive designs.

**Best Practices:**
- Use vertical or horizontal Auto Layout for all component containers
- Set consistent spacing with "Space Between Items"
- Utilize "Fill Container" for responsive elements

### Component Variants and Properties

Component variants in Figma create a direct mapping to component props in code:

```
Button (Component)
├── Primary (Variant)
├── Secondary (Variant)
├── Outlined (Variant)
└── Text (Variant)
```

**Properties to Define:**
- State: Default, Hover, Pressed, Disabled
- Size: Small, Medium, Large
- Icon Position: Left, Right, Icon Only

### Design Tokens and Variables

Use Figma Variables for all:
- Color values
- Typography styles
- Spacing values
- Border radii
- Shadow styles

This creates a direct mapping to CSS variables or theme configuration.

## Documentation for Developers

Add developer-specific annotations directly in Figma:
- Component behavior descriptions
- Interactive state information
- Responsive behavior notes
- Animation specifications

## Preparing for Export

1. Enable Dev Mode in Figma
2. Create a dedicated handoff page with all components
3. Organize components by type (Navigation, Forms, Cards, etc.)
4. Use the "Ready for Development" status flag

By following these guidelines, you'll create Figma designs that are optimally structured for AI-assisted code conversion, resulting in higher quality code output and faster development cycles.
