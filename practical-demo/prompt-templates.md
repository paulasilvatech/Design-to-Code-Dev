## üí° Pro Tips for Prompts

### 1. Be Specific About Technology
```
Bad: "Convert this design to code"
Good: "Convert this design to React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion"
```

### 2. Define Component Structure
```
Bad: "Make it responsive"
Good: "Create responsive breakpoints: mobile (< 768px), tablet (768-1024px), desktop (> 1024px)"
```

### 3. Specify State Management
```
Bad: "Add interactivity"
Good: "Use Zustand for global state, React Hook Form for forms, and React Query for server state"
```

### 4. Include Performance Requirements
```
Bad: "Make it fast"
Good: "Optimize with lazy loading, code splitting, image optimization, and achieve 90+ Lighthouse score"
```

### 5. Request Folder Structure
```
Bad: "Organize the code"
Good: "Use this structure:
src/
  components/
  hooks/
  utils/
  styles/
  types/
  services/"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Prompts

### When Results Are Incomplete
```
The previous generation was incomplete. Please continue from where you left off and:
1. Complete the [COMPONENT_NAME] component
2. Add the missing styles
3. Include all image exports
4. Finish the responsive breakpoints
```

### When Code Needs Optimization
```
Optimize the generated code for:
- Performance (lazy loading, memoization)
- Bundle size (tree shaking, dynamic imports)
- SEO (meta tags, structured data)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
```

### When Styling Doesn't Match
```
The styling doesn't match the Figma design. Please:
1. Use exact colors from Figma: [LIST_COLORS]
2. Match spacing/padding precisely
3. Implement the exact border radius
4. Use the correct font weights
5. Add missing hover states
```

## üé® Design-Specific Prompts

### For Complex Layouts
```
This Figma design has a complex grid layout. Generate CSS Grid code that:
- Handles all breakpoints
- Maintains aspect ratios
- Uses named grid areas
- Includes fallbacks for older browsers
```

### For Micro-interactions
```
Add these micro-interactions from the Figma prototype:
1. Button hover effects with scale
2. Card lift on hover
3. Smooth color transitions
4. Loading state animations
5. Success/error state feedback
```

### For Dark Mode
```
The Figma file includes dark mode designs. Implement:
- CSS custom properties for theming
- System preference detection
- Smooth theme transitions
- Persistent theme selection
- Proper contrast ratios
```

Remember: The more specific and structured your prompt, the better the generated code will match your Figma design!
