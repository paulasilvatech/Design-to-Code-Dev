## About

The Design-to-Code Playbook is a comprehensive, practical guide for transforming Figma designs into production-ready code. Created for developers, designers, and teams working at the intersection of design and development, this playbook bridges the gap between visual design and implementation.

### What is this playbook?

This playbook provides a structured, step-by-step approach to converting Figma designs into high-quality code using modern tools like VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI. Rather than just theoretical concepts, it offers practical workflows, code examples, and hands-on exercises to build real-world components and applications.

### Who is it for?

- **Frontend Developers** looking to streamline their design-to-code workflow
- **UI/UX Designers** wanting to understand how their designs translate to code
- **Full-Stack Developers** expanding their frontend skills
- **Technical Leads** seeking to establish design system implementation practices
- **Teams** aiming to improve collaboration between design and development

### What's included?

- üìö **Comprehensive documentation** covering the entire design-to-code process
- üß© **Framework-specific implementation guides** for React, Angular, and more
- üß™ **Hands-on workshops** (1-hour demo and 3-hour deep dive)
- üîß **Practical code examples** and component implementations
- üõ†Ô∏è **Best practices** for accessibility, performance, and maintainability
- ü§ñ **AI-assisted workflows** leveraging GitHub Copilot and Azure AI
- üß† **Troubleshooting guides** and common pitfall solutions

### How to use this playbook

This repository is structured as a learning journey. Start with the fundamentals in the documentation section, then explore the framework-specific guides that match your tech stack. When you're ready for hands-on practice, follow the 1-hour demo session or dive deeper with the 3-hour workshop.
